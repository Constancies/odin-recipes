# Odin Recipes

A simple recipe site demonstrating basic HTML features such as lists,
links, and images.

## Learning intention

I already have a bit of experience with HTML and CSS working on my
personal website, so I'll use this as an opportunity to teach myself
Git repository mirroring. I prefer using my 
[Codeberg account](https://codeberg.org/constancies) over GitHub for
a few reasons (chief among them being Microsoft's predatory AI policy).
While you clearly are still reading this on GitHub, the original
repository lives on Codeberg, and you'll find that most of my repos
also live there and *not* on GitHub. Just a personal choice 🤷

## Reflection

Though the HTML parts of this were mostly a breeze, I did find it
was helpful as it solidified what I already knew. I think when I
write more HTML in the future, I'll have a stronger understanding
of its best practices now.

The most annoying part of this project was copying the recipe text.
It wasn't difficult, just long and tedius. I originally wanted to
have it word-wrapped in the HTML file to look neat, but eventually
I gave up on that and just copy-pasta'd it.

One thing I found surprisingly helpful about this exercise was that
it was a good opportunity to showcase what I'd learned about Git
commit messages. I kind of realized this too late, as by the time I
made my first major commit I'd already finished the project for the
most part. But I made a few additions afterward and this was a great
chance to make more detailed, useful commit messages.

Finally, it turns out that mirroring a repository is actually quite
easy; it's just a matter of using the `--mirror` flag in Git and
pointing to a repository URL you have access to. I'm happy I got to
try this out.
