# Odin Recipes

A simple recipe site demonstrating basic HTML features such as lists,
links, and images.

## Learning intention

I already have a bit of experience with HTML and CSS working on my
personal website, so I'll use this as an opportunity to teach myself
Git repository mirroring. I prefer using my 
[Codeberg account](https://codeberg.org/constancies) over GitHub for
a few reasons (chief among them being Microsoft's predatory AI policy).
While you clearly are still reading this on GitHub, the original
repository lives on Codeberg, and you'll find that most of my repos
also live there and *not* on GitHub. Just a personal choice 🤷
