      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>1/4 cup salted butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
        Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</li>
        <li>To make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted
        water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally,
        until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish
        cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Gradually whisk 2 ½ cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed. </li>
        <li>Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.</li>
      </ol>
